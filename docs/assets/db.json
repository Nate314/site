To run a java program inside of it, drag and drop the jar file into the NathaNOS1.1/assets and you should be ready to go!</p> <p>Note: if you want to add one of your own java programs to NathaNOS, then you will have to make the main class extend a JFrame, and you will have to make the constructor of your main class have one parameter that is a Boolean for visibility. You can see an example below:<pre><code>package clock;\n\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\n\npublic class Main extends JFrame\n{\n\tpublic Main(Boolean visibility)\t{\n\t\tthis.setVisible(visibility.booleanValue());\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>"
